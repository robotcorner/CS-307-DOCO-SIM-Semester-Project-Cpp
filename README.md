# CS-307-DOCO-SIM-Semester-Project

## Task Overview

- This is a semester long project where we deliver a simulation program, then deliver a version with new contraints and design pattern requirements, and then add a GUI at the end.

## Program Overview - Digital One Celled Organism (DOCO) Simulation

### Summary

- This is a console program that will run a simulation of a world where single celled organisms are spawned in. 
- They will run around eating the food nearby and avoiding walking past the edge of the world. 
- They will avoid walking into each other too. 
- They now also avoid running into obstacles. 
- Additionally, strategy pattern and factory pattern have been implemented to allow for different types of DOCOs. 
- The initial world specifications (height, width, DOCOâ€™s and positions, and food locations) will be read in from a provided file in XML format. 
- As part of version two, the DOCO strategy is also read in. There are a lot of details involved and they are specified below.

### Tasks and Errors to Fix Prioritized:
1. Doco movement occasionally returns move pairs that are out of bounds of the world, thus crashing the program.
1. Last doco is spawned as alive = false
	- This is wrong. It's killed while having full energy
1. Unsure if the Doco Split works at all, or if it will crash program, need to get it to run longer first to see.
